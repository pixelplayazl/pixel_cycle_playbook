### Pixel Cycle Playbook

## Overview
Pixel Play operates in fixed five-week cycles.
Each cycle finishes one project, and with 52 weeks in a year,
the team aims to complete 10 projects annually.

### What is a Pixel Cycle?
- One cycle lasts 5 weeks.
- The goal is to complete 1 project per cycle.
- meaning we can finish 10 projects in a year

### What is a Project?
- A project is something that a team wants to finish in a cycle ( 5 weeks )
- It can be a request, a problem to fix, or any work item that adds value.

### How Projects Are Created
- At the last week of the cycle (week 5) a  Project Proposals for the next cycle are
drafted, discussed, and selected.
- A meeting is held to discuss and select the appropriate project for the next cycle.

How to Write a Project Proposal ?

A Project Proposal should scope the following:

1) Problem
- What problem does the project solve?
- Why is this work worth a project?

2) Solution
- What is the proposed solution?
- Make sure that the problem have a solution so that we are not stuck chasing goose

3) Scope
- The project should be large enough to justify ~40 hours/week for 4 weeks, yet small
enough to finish within the cycle.
- todos and not todos to help with scoping :
  - 3.1 Todos: List all tasks required to finish the project this cycle.
  - 3.2 NotTodos: Outline things to avoid or deprioritize during this cycle.
- Note: Scope may be adjusted during the cycle if necessary.

4) Assignments
- Identify the people responsible for the project and their roles.
