### Pixel Cycle Playbook

## Overview
Pixel Play operates in fixed five-week cycles. Each cycle finishes one project, and with 52 weeks in a year, the team aims to complete 10 projects annually.

### What is a Pixel Cycle?
- One cycle lasts 5 weeks.
- The goal is to complete 1 project per cycle.
- meaning we can finish 10 projects in a year

### What is a Project?
- A project is something that a team wants to finish in a cycle ( 5 weeks )
- It can be a request, a problem to fix, or any work item that adds value.

### How Projects Are Created
- Week 5: Project Proposals for the next cycle are drafted, discussed, and selected.
- Weeks 1–4: Execution on the current cycle’s project continues.
- A meeting is held to discuss and select the appropriate project for the next cycle.

How to Write a Project Proposal
Note: Proposals are drafted and finalized in Week 5 for the next cycle.

A Project Proposal should scope the following (to be completed in Week 5):

1) Problem
- What problem does the project solve?
- Why is this work worth doing?

2) Solution
- What is the proposed solution?
- Ensure there is a concrete path to deliver a closed outcome.

3) Scope
- The project should be large enough to justify ~40 hours/week for 4 weeks, yet small enough to finish within the cycle.
- todos and not todos to help scoping :
  3.1 Todos: List all tasks required to finish the project this cycle.
  3.2 NotTodos: Outline things to avoid or deprioritize during this cycle.
- Note: Scope can be adjusted during the cycle if necessary.

4) Assignments
- Identify the people responsible for the project and their roles.
